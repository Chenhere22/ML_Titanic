# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. The infamous sinking of the Titanic serves as a challenging dataset for building predictive models that estimate the likelihood of survival based on factors like age, gender, socio-economic class, and other personal attributes.

## The Challenge

The RMS Titanic, often described as "unsinkable," tragically sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew members on board, 1,502 lost their lives due to the insufficient number of lifeboats.

This project aims to answer the question: **"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"** using a dataset containing passenger information such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify passengers as either survivors or non-survivors. By exploring and analyzing the data, we can identify trends and correlations between survival and various passenger attributes.

### Main Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and transform data into suitable formats.
- Exploratory data analysis to discover relationships between features like gender, age, class, and survival rates.
- Implementation of machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers who were on board the Titanic. It includes columns such as:
- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger.
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`: Basic demographic information.
- `SibSp`, `Parch`: Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`, `Fare`: Ticket details and fare paid.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

The target variable is `Survived`, which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:
